To Do:
- Convert consolidated SVO to DAG
- Update the image output function to traverse the DAG

- Fix Github readme.md to point to new blog for progress
- Make function to write/read SVO to/from disk for faster iteration

DAG Implementation
- Implement DAG
   - Build top N-10 levels from top down as an SVO
   - For each leaf of those N-10 top levels:
      - Build an SVO
      - Convert SVO to a DAG
         - Make sure the DAG copies everything into new memory so we can release all the SVO's memory
      - Connect DAG to leaf of top N-10 levels
   - Do one more pass to convert whole tree into DAG

Notes:
- I have Validated that the number of updates for the leafs is what is to be expected
- I have validated that the parents of the leafs have been updated correctly
- I have validated that the each level is being consolidated and updated
