To Do:
- Write voxel cache (voxelization to a certain level stored as tga's so that if it has already been voxelized at that level I can just read in the cache)
   - This will HEAVILY speed up development

- Fix Github readme.md to point to new blog for progress
- Make function to write/read SVO to/from disk for faster iteration

DAG Implementation
- Implement DAG
   - Build top N-10 levels from top down as an SVO
   - For each leaf of those N-10 top levels:
      - Build an SVO
      - Convert SVO to a DAG
         - Make sure the DAG copies everything into new memory so we can release all the SVO's memory
      - Connect DAG to leaf of top N-10 levels
   - Do one more pass to convert whole tree into DAG

Notes:
- To render bunny with decent shape run: 
   ./main bunny.obj 6 ccm > test.out

Debugging Ideas:
- 

Performance Oportunities
- Leaf node intersection
