To Do:
- Add material indices to the moxel table along with the material table

- Remove all print outs
- Print the number of nodes at each level
- Calculate the ammount of memory it would take if implemented most efficientlt
- Figure out test scene that can fit in 9 voxel levels
- Get some clarification on the level of detail a thesis needs to be written to


Done:

- Figure out what the expected normals should be
   - Print out for every set voxel, the triangle # and the normal
      - Do this in voxels.cpp
   - In the moxel table construction, print out the voxel index, the triangle, and the normal
   - Compare these to see where things go wrong


- Add to DAG Nodes the empty voxel counts   (DONE)
   - Calculate the number of empty voxels to the left of each node
      - For each unique leaf node calculate its empty counts and put it in a map with the key as its memory address and its value as the empty count
      - For each level above the leafs
         - For each node at that level
            - For each node's children
               - Calculate its empty count based on the empty count map of the previous level
            - Save to the empty count area of the node the empty counts for the first seven children
            - Make a map of the current level with the keys being the address of the current node and the values being the total empty count of all of its children for that node

- Calculate the index in the Moxel Table while traversing  (DONE as far as I can tell without testing)
   - Calculate what index it would be if we had data for all voxels (even the empty ones) by keeping a running indexSum where at each level
      - indexSum = (numLevels - currentLevel - 1) * index;
   - Calculate the number of nodes that are empty by keeping a running emptySum where...
      - For every node you traverse
         - emptySum += getEmptyCount(allNodesToLeftOfIt)
         - Which means get the empty counts for all the childrens indices are less than the current


   - moxelIndex = indexSum - emptySum

- Create the Moxel Table (Material Voxel Table)
   - Turn off voxel caching
      - This is necessary to allow us to calculate per voxel normals from the triangles
   - After voxelization calculate the number of filled voxels
   - Allocate material info for each voxel 
      - 1 x uint32_t for the material index 
      - 3 x sizeof(float) for the normal
   - Allocate and fill the material information array
   - Loop through all the voxels starting at index 0 and calculate its normal
      - For each triangle:
         - Get the Normal
         - Method 1: Make a ray where:
            - The eye is the center of the voxel
            - The direction is the inverse normal of the triangle (i.e. the normal * -1.0f)
            - Calculate ray-triangle intersection
            - If it intersects:
               - Check to see if the intersection is within the distance from the center of the voxel to one of its corners
            - If it is, set the normal for that voxel as the normal of the triangle and break out of the triangle loop
      - Set the material index


Notes:
- To render bunny with decent shape run: 
   ./main bunny.obj 6 > test.out

Debugging Ideas:
- 

Performance Oportunities
- Leaf node intersection

Timing of Voxelization and Raytracing
- bunny (~5k triangles)
   - 7 levels: real  0m41.731s
   - 8 levels: real  5m27.643s


Voxel Number Calculation (Binary Tree) in 
- As you traverse the tree:
   - Calculate what index it would be if we had data for all voxels (even the empty ones) by keeping a running indexSum where at each level
      - If you go to a right child 
         - indexSum += 2^(numLevels - currLevelNumber - 1)
         - numLevels doesn't include the root
         - The root is level 0, the roots children are level 1, ... the leafs are level numLevels
   - Calculate the number of nodes that are empty by keeping a running emptySum where
      - If you go to a right child:
         - emptySum += emptyCount
         - emptyCount is the number stored next to the mask
- shadingIndex = indexSum - emptySum

Calculate the Point on the Triangle Within the Voxel That is Sampled for Normals/UVs/etc
- Clip the triangle to the AABB creating a polygon 
- Calculate the centroid of the polygon and return that
   - This can be done by breaking the polygon into multiple triangles and returning the average of the area weighted centroids of the triangles
   -  See "Centroid of a 3D shell described by 3 vertex facets" at http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonmesh/

Clip a Triangle to AABB and find the centroid
- 5 Cases
   - Triangle Completely within AABB
      - Condition: All points are within the AABB
         - Return the centroid of the triangle
   - 1 Plane intersection 
      - Condition: The points are outside the AABB in only 1 axis direction (i.e. +x, -x, +y, -y, +z, or -z)
         - Using line-plane intersection, find the points where the plane of the AABB intersect with the triangle, and add them to the set of the points that are contained within the AABB (making a convex hull)
         - Use the Incremental Algorithm on the convex hull and return the returned triangles
   - 2 Plane Intersection 
      - Condition: The points are outside the AABB in only 2 axis directions (i.e. +x, -x, +y, -y, +z, or -z)
         - Using line-plane intersection, find the points where the plane of the AABB intersect with the triangle, and add them to the set of the points that are contained within the AABB (making a convex hull)
         - Use the Incremental Algorithm on the convex hull and return the returned triangles
   - 3 Plane Intersection 
      - Condition: The points are outside the AABB in only 3 axis directions (i.e. +x, -x, +y, -y, +z, or -z)
         - Using line-plane intersection, find the points where the plane of the AABB intersect with the triangle, and add them to the set of the points that are contained within the AABB (making a convex hull)
         - Use the Incremental Algorithm on the convex hull and return the returned triangles
   - 4 Plane Intersection 
      - Condition: The points are outside the AABB in only 4 axis directions (i.e. +x, -x, +y, -y, +z, or -z)
         - Using line-plane intersection, find the points where the plane of the AABB intersect with the triangle, and add them to the set of the points that are contained within the AABB (making a convex hull)
         - Use the Incremental Algorithm on the convex hull and return the returned triangles

Incremental Algorithm
- Sort the convex hull along the x-axis
- P is a point in the convex hull
- N is the number of points in the convex hull
- for (i = 0; i <= N - 3; i++)
   - P_i, P_i+1, P_i+2 make a triangle
