To Do:
- Debug raytracer
   - Test axis AABB intersect code
   - Find out where it is returning false
   - Stop after one or two levels and see if it works

- Fix Github readme.md to point to new blog for progress
- Make function to write/read SVO to/from disk for faster iteration

DAG Implementation
- Implement DAG
   - Build top N-10 levels from top down as an SVO
   - For each leaf of those N-10 top levels:
      - Build an SVO
      - Convert SVO to a DAG
         - Make sure the DAG copies everything into new memory so we can release all the SVO's memory
      - Connect DAG to leaf of top N-10 levels
   - Do one more pass to convert whole tree into DAG
